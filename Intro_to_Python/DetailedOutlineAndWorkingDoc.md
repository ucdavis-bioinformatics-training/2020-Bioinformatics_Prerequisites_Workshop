    -  [Basic data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html)
        +  Integers, Floating-point numbers, boolean, 
            - abs(), 
        +  Strings
            -  Single and double quotes, escape characters, etc
                -  triple-quote strings

        -  if statements
        -  range
        -  break, continue, pass
        -  For Loops, while etc
        -  Iterators - what is an iterator, how does it work?
